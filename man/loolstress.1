.SH NAME
loolstress \- stress testing tool for LibreOffice Online.
.SH SYNOPSIS
loolstress [OPTIONS] SERVER PATH1 TRACE1 ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
.PP
Re-play trace files, either gzip compressed or verbatim against
a given server URL to simulate load against the server. A single
loolstress command can easily replay many concurrent traces.
.PP
If the same PATH is provided for multiple traces, then these are
both executed against the same document.
.SH COMMANDS AND OPTIONS
.PP
.SS "General options:"
\fB\-h\fR, \fB\-\-help\fR                Show this usage information.
.SS "SERVER"
The server parameter points to a websocket end-point that would be
used by LibreOffice Online to drive a document editing session.
.PP
\fBExample:\fR loolstress wss://localhost:9980 /tmp/test.odt test/traces/hello-world.txt
.SS "Generating traces"
To generate a trace, set the following settings to these values in:
\fBloolwsd.xml\fR: \fBtrace\fR true, \fBtrace.path\fR /tmp/trace.txt.gz
.PP
Re-start loolwsd, edit some documents and then load and
edit a document, after terminating loolwsd it should save a trace.
.PP
If passing extra parameters to loolwsd pass: --o:trace[@enable]=true --o:trace.path=/tmp/trace.txt.gz.
.PP
.SH "NOTE"
Please note that recording traces generated by mashing the keyboard rapidly creates a pathologically
unrealistic profile that is 10x faster than the average typer, and 5x worse then a professional typist
in terms of keys-per-second, as well as creating unusual documents from a spell/grammar checking
perspective.
